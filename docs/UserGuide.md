## Introduction

**Vimification** is a **desktop app** built for Vim enthusasts to manage tasks and deadlines, optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a **Graphical User Interface** (GUI).

**Vimification** is modelled after **Vim**, so the command syntax for the Vimificaiton CLI closely mimics **Vim**.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Purpose of this User Guide

The purpose of this user guide is to provide you with a comprehensive guide on using the various features and functionality of the app, so that you can efficiently manage your tasks and deadlines using Vimification's powerful and intuitive interface.

The guide will walk you through the process of creating and managing tasks, setting due dates, prioritizing work, and tracking progress, among other topics. It will also provide you with clear and concise instructions that are easy to follow, whether you are a new user or an experienced Vim enthusiast. Additionally, it will offer troubleshooting tips and solutions to common issues that you may encounter while using Vimification.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Quick Start

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Navigating Vimification

Similar to Vim, you can use the `j` and `k` (or `↓` and `↑`) key to move down and up the task-list respectively.

Assuming we already have some tasks loaded in Vimification (we'll show you how to add tasks later), pressing `j` brings us down.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/2.before-j.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/3.after-j.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

Similarly, pressing `k` brings us up the task list.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/4.before-k.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/5.after-k.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Vim, pressing `l` moves you to the right, but in Vimification, pressing `l` would move you to the right-side panel and display the task detail.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/6.before-l.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/7.after-l.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

In Vim, pressing `h` moves you to the left, but in Vimification, pressing `h` would move you back to the task list (and hence clear out the right-side panel!).

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>
      Before
    </th>
    <th>
      After
    </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/10.before-h.png">
    </td>
    <td>
      <img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/11.after-h.png">
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

**NOTE: If at any point when you are unable to navigate the task list, pressing `j` or `k` multiple times will cause Vimification to refocus onto the task-list and work again, otherwise, use your mouse to click on the task list in Vimification to recalibrate the focus.**

**NOTE: It is not recommended to use arrow key, because it is not supported!**

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Exiting Vimification

Similiar to Vim, you can quit Vimification by typing `:quit` or `:q!` on your keyboard while in Vimification.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/8.quit.png">
<br><br>
<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

### Trying out the commands

Similar to Vim, you can access command mode by **pressing the `:` key** on your keyboard. This will shift the focus to the command input field, which is at the bottom of the application.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/9.showcommand.png" alt="Example of Show Command Image" title="How to bring up the command input">

Type the command in the command box and press the `Enter` key to execute it. e.g. typing **`:help`** and pressing `Enter` will open the help window.

Some example commands you can try:

- `:a "tutorial"` : Adds a task with the title `tutorial` to Vimification.

- `:a "quiz for cs2103T" -d 2023-04-01` : Adds a task with the title `quiz for cs2103T` and deadline `2023-04-01` to Vimification.

- `:d 2` : Deletes the 2nd task shown in the current list.

- `:quit` : Exits Vimification.

- `:help` : Brings up the manual page.

2. Refer to the [Features and commands](#features-and-commands) below for details of each command.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Using the commands

Similar to Vim, you can access command mode by **pressing the `:` key** on your keyboard. This will shift the focus to the command input field, which is at the bottom of the application.

<img class="ui-img" src="images/ug-images/9.showcommand.png" alt="Example of Show Command Image" title="How to bring up the command input">

**NOTE: Besides the navigation commands (`h`, `j`, `k`, `l`), every command always starts with a colon (`:`).**

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## General information on a task's attributes

In Vimification, a task can has the following attributes:

| Attribute | Its meaning & purpose                                | Flag | The range of values it accepts                                               |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Title     | Name or general description of a task.               | `-t` | One single word, or any phrase enclosed in quotation marks (`""` or `''`)\*. |
| Deadline  | The date (and time) the task is due at.              | `-d` | In the format of `yyyy-MM-dd`, `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm`, `EEE` or `EEE HH:mm`^.    |
| Labels    | The labels that the task has.                        | `-l` | One single word, or any phrase enclosed in quotation marks (`""` or `''`)\*. |
| Status    | Status of a task, indicating that is it done or not. | `-s` | 0, 1, or 2. See below for more details.                                      |
| Priority  | How important/urgent a task is.                      | `-p` | 0, 1, 2 or 3. See below for more details.                                    |

^`EEE` format accepts the first 3 letters of a day of week (`Mon`, `Tue`, etc.), case insensitive.

\*For a title or label, if the phrase is one single word, the quotation marks are optional. Another 2 constraints on the quotation marks are:

- There can be at most 2 nested quotation marks &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so `"Say 'SUPER "Cheesy"' "` and `'Say "SUPER 'Cheesy'" '` are not allowed).
- 2 nested quotation marks cannot be the same types &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (so `"Say "cheese" "` and `'Say 'cheese' '` are not allowed).

| Priority | Meaning          |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 0        | Unknown priority |
| 1        | Very urgent      |
| 2        | Urgent           |
| 3        | Not urgent       |

| Status | Meaning     |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 0      | Not done    |
| 1      | In progress |
| 2      | Completed   |

<p style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Information on commands' parameters

_Take note of how the command format is being interpretted, to know what parameters it requires._

Flags like `-d`, `-l` and `-p` act as identifier for the parameter that comes immediately after the flag.

- e.g. `:a "<title>" [-d <deadline>]`, the `-d` indicates the deadline attribute of a task.

Words in **angle brackets** are **compulsory** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. in `:a <title>`, the user must provide the `<title>` parameter, for example, `:a "Do weekly quiz"`.

Words in **square brackets** are **optional** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. `:a "<title>" [-d <deadline>]`, the user can provide flag `-d` with the `<deadline>` parameter (but this is not compulsory).

Bracketed items with `…`​ behind means that user can provide multiple parameters.

- e.g. `:a <title> [-l <label>]…​`, for example, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101` and `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101 -l presentation` are both acceptable.

Parameters identified by flags can be in any order.

- e.g. `:a "Do OP2 slides" -l cs2101 -p 1`, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -p 1 -l cs2101` are both acceptable.

Some flags can be used with alternative forms.

- e.g. `-d` flag (to identify the deadline attribute of a task) can also be used with `--deadline`.

Redundant parameter(s) at the end will raise an error, and the command will not be executed.

- e.g. if the user inputs `:help 123`, the command `help` will not be executed, and they will receive an error message.

Note:

- If both flag `-a` and flag `-o` are not provided, you can only use a single argument.
- You cannot use flag `-a` and flag `-o` at the same time.
- If flag `-a` is provided, the conditions are combined with **and** operator. If there is no other flag, all tasks will be selected.
- If flag `-o` is provided, the conditions are combined with **or** operator. If there is no other flag, no task will be selected.

### Sorting task

Sort by the parameters as specified by the flag.

Format: `:s [-d] [-s] [-p]`

| Flag | Alternative form |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `-d` | `--deadline`     |
| `-s` | `--status`       |
| `-p` | `--priority`     |

Example of command:

1. `:s -s` sort for tasks by status
2. `:s -d` sort for tasks by deadline
3. `:s -p` sort for tasks by priority level

Note:

- Only one flag should be present.

### Refreshing task list

Refresh the task list and revert it back to the original state by removing any filter or sort.

Format: `:refresh`

### Undoing the previous command

Format: `:undo`

You can undo the previous command by simply keying in `:undo`.

### Using macro

Sometimes we might be adding the exact same task every week, say `:a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz"`. Typing repeated and identical command could be time consuming and Vimification is aware of it. This is where the **macro feature** comes in.

Macro is a customisable template-like command, to streamline the process of running repeated commands. For example, you can define a macro `cs2103t` that maps to `a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz" -d Fri 14:00`. Afterward, whenever you type `:cs2103t`, your input will be transformed into `:a "Do CS2103 weekly quiz" -d Fri 14:00`.

### Adding macro

Format: `:macro -a <macro> <command_string>`

| Parameter          | Detail                                         | Example          |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `<macro>`          | The macro to be defined, can only be one word  | `CS2103T`          |
| `<command_string>` | The command string to be mapped with the macro | `"a 'CS2103T quiz' -d Fri 14:00"` |

Example of command:
1. `:macro -a CS2103T "a 'CS2103T quiz' -d Fri 14:00"`. Users can now use the shortcut `:CS2103T` to add the task for every recurrence.

Note:

- If the macro is already defined, this command will replaced the old mapping with the new one.

### Deleting a macro

Format: `macro -d <macro>`

| Parameter | Detail                                        | Example |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `<macro>` | The macro to be deleted, can only be one word | `CS2103T` |

Example of command:
1. `:macro -d CS2103T`

### View all macros defined in the application

You can view all macros and their mappings by keying in `:macro -l`.

### Exiting the application

(Somwhat) similar to Vim, we can use the `:quit` or `:q!` to exit the application.

### Saving the task list data

The task list data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing existing task list data

Existing task list data is saved at a JSON file `[JAR file location]/.vimification/tasklist.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

### Editing existing macro data

Existing macro data is saved at a JSON file `[JAR file location]/.vimification/macromap.json`. Users can edit this file directly to manages the macros that can be used in the application.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Vimification will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.

</div>
