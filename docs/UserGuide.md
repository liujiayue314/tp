## Navigating Vimification

Vimification is designed to mimic Vim as closely as possible. Navigate Vimification as you would in Vim by using `h`,`j`,`k`,`l` to move to the left, down, up, right respectively. To open the detailed task list, use 'l'.

Moreover, the usual arrow keys (&uarr;, &darr;, &larr;, &rarr;) can be used as well.

<p class="back-to-top" style="text-align: right"><a href="#table-of-contents">Back to Top &#8593;</a></p>

## Using the commands

Similar to Vim, you can access command mode by **pressing the `:` key** on your keyboard. This will bring the cursor to the command input field, which is at the bottom of the application.</p>
Example:

## Information on commands' parameters

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

<!-- *IMPORTANT: Take note of how the command format is being interpretted, to know what parameters it requires.* -->

_Take note of how the command format is being interpretted, to know what parameters it requires._

Flags like `-d`, `-l` and `-p` act as identifier for the parameter that comes immediately after the flag.

- e.g. `:a <"title"> [-d <deadline>]`, the `-d` indicates the deadline attribute of a task.
- Refer to the [Flag summary](#flag-summary) below for details of each flag.

Words in **angle brackets** are **compulsory** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. in `:a <"title">`, the user must provide the `<"title">` parameter, for example, `:a "Do weekly quiz"`.

Words in **square brackets** are **optional** parameters to be supplied by the user.

- e.g. `:a <"title"> [-d <deadline>]`, the user need not provide the `<deadline>` parameter.

Bracketed items with `…`​ behind means that user can provide multiple parameters.

- e.g. `:a <'title"> [-l <label>]…​`, for example, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -t cs2101`, `:a Do OP2 slides -t cs2101 -t presentation` are both acceptable.

Parameters identified by flags can be in any order.

- e.g. `:a "Do OP2 slides" -t cs2101 -p high`, `:a "Do OP2 slides" -p high -t cs2101` are both acceptable.

For commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`), any parameter provided will be ignored.

- e.g. if the user inputs `:help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Vimification will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
